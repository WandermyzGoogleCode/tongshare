The following is an interesting comment from devise.rb.
{{{
  # ==> Navigation configuration
  # Lists the formats that should be treated as navigational. Formats like
  # :html, should redirect to the sign in page when the user does not have
  # access, but formats like :xml or :json, should return 401.
  # If you have any extra navigational formats, like :iphone or :mobile, you
  # should add them to the navigational formats lists. Default is [:html]
  # config.navigational_formats = [:html, :iphone]

见[http://www.cnblogs.com/sinkzephyr/archive/2008/03/17/1110241.html]，其中有说如何将`NetBeans`通过比较优美的办法变成英文版的。另外，还说了怎么搞出IRB，这对于WINDOWS用户来说还是很不错的吧。
